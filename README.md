This is a simple trainer for learning the 自動詞 (self-move) and 他動詞 (other-move) form of common verbs.

The quiz will present you with an image and a verb. You'll then need to decide if it's a 自動詞 or 他動詞 verb, then remember the other version from memory. Pressing the "Next" button will allow you to check your answer.
